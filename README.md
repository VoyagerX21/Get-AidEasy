## ⚠️ Heads-Up!

> 💤 **Patience, Padawan!**  
> This site is hosted on Render’s free tier — if it’s been asleep for a bit, it might take a few seconds to wake up. Totally normal. Just let it stretch and boot up. 🐢💻

> 🤖 **AI Mood Swings!**  
> Sometimes the Gemini API gets a bit dramatic and throws a 500 error. Just refresh the page or hit the "Regenerate" button — it usually sorts itself out. 😅
